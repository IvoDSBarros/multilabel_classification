# Multilabel classification task on rock news articles
# Overview
Based upon a previous rule-based text classification model, an hybrid multilabel classifier was developed to assign topic labels to a dataset of rock news headlines, aiming to explore this variant of the classification problem and enhance its accuracy. This repository presents the steps implemented to develop the multilabel classification task. Several classifiers were tested including the ones following the problem transformation approach and the MultiOutputClassifier.

# 1. Exploratory data analysis
+ The dataset contains 20.000 headlines and the average number of labels per headline stands at 1.45 (see Table 1).
+ 36 predefined labels were derived from the rule-based text classification model (see Table 1).
+ The number of labels for which a headline can be assigned ranges from 1 to 7 (see Figure 1).
+ Two-thirds of the headlines are assigned to a single topic label, while nearly one-fourth are tagged with two topic labels (see Figure 1).
+ The cumulative percentage of headlines assigned to more than three labels is not significant (see Figure 1).
+ The text corpus shows high imbalance (see Figure 2). 
+ Nearly one-third of the headlines (6,397 out of 20,000) are tagged with the class 'diverse', indicating topics other than the 35 predefined labels in this classification task (see Figure 2).
+ Core topic labels include: 'announce', 'release', 'album', 'tour', 'song', 'show', 'watch', 'video', 'single', 'death', 'play' and 'cover' (see Figure 2).
+ Most topic labels tend to co-occur with another label rather than being associated with multiple labels or appearing as a single label (see Figure 2).
+ Exceptions to this pattern include 'song', 'death' or 'cover', which tend to appear as single labels, and 'video' and 'single' which are more associated with multiple labels (see Figure 2).
+ Strong correlations are observed among pairs of labels such as ['tour', 'announce'], ['album', 'announce'], ['album', 'release'], ['single', 'release'] and ['video', 'release'] (see Figure 3).

## 2. About the methodology
+ The multilabel classification task was constructed based on a rule-based text classification model with the purpose of identifying keywords and assigning both topic labels and publication type categories. Details about the rule-based text classification model can be found [here](https://github.com/IvoDSBarros/rock-is-not-dead_nlp-experiments-on-rock-news-articles/blob/main/README.md#rule-based-text-classification). The keywords generated by the manual rule-based model served as the foundation for assigning topic labels to headlines. Instead of directly using the derived topic labels, the multilabel classifier relies on the identified keywords.
+ To ensure a *"well-balanced distribution of label relations"*, an iterative stratification technique was implemented to split the dataset into training and testing sets, as proposed by Szymański and Kajdanowicz (2016). The test size was set at 0.2.
+ In order to address potential class imbalance, no re-sampling or re-weighting methods were employed, as they tend to *"result in oversampling of common labels"* (Huang et al., 2021).
+ Various classifiers and estimators were evaluated using both Problem Transformation and MultiOutputClassifier approaches.
+ Emphasis was placed on inherently robust algorithms for imbalanced datasets, particularly tree-based and ensemble methods (Ganganwar, 2012; Mahani, 2022; Mulugeta et al., 2023).
+ Hyperparameter optimization was conducted using Grid Search for models showing high performance with default parameters.
+ A cost-sensitive learning experiment was carried out by adjusting the "class_weight" parameter of a tree-based classifier. However, no significant impact on the model's performance was observed.
+ To assess model performance on imbalanced datasets, informative evaluation metrics such as the Micro-average F1-score were employed. This metric aggregates the contributions of *"all the units together, without taking into consideration possible differences between classes"* (Grandini et al., 2020).
